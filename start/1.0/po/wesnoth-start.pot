"Battle for Wesnoth is one of very few successful Free/Open Source games. The "
"focus of development has been to make a game that is as fun and enjoyable as "
"possible for its creators -- with the hope that others might share the same "
"tastes as the creators -- rather than to reach the maximum market possible. "
"This approach has led to an environment where a unique game could be created "
"that won't be to everyone's tastes, but which some people will love enough "
"to spend hundreds of hours playing."

"Battle for Wesnoth features simple, fun gameplay that is easy to learn, but "
"is of considerable depths. The single player experience includes four "
"campaigns which are packaged with the game, each with an engaging storyline "
"and strong AI."

"Battle for Wesnoth also contains a vibrant community of campaign makers who "
"have made dozens of additional campaigns that may be downloaded and "
"installed easily from within the game itself. Aspiring campaign makers and "
"scenario designers can easily add their own campaigns using the Wesnoth map "
"editor and the flexibility of Wesnoth's scriptable engine."

"but also embodies time, effort and talent from David and dozens of "
