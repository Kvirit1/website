"The single player mode has a new tutorial, and 3 new campaigns: Two "
"Brothers, The South Guard, and Under the Burning Suns. The first one was "
"intentionally designed to be easy for beginning players. The last one is set "
"in an environment quite different from that of the typical Wesnoth campaign, "
"and includes a few changes to game rules. The existing campaigns include new "
"scenarios, dialogue, items, and optional bonus victory objectives. Replay of "
"saved games has been improved considerably, allowing one to show single "
"turns at a time, navigate through the replay, and toggle <em>fog-of-war</em> "
"at will."

"Multiplayer has new features, making the internet or LAN mode a more "
"pleasant experience. It allows setting a per-turn time limit, sending "
"private messages to allies, and banning unwelcome users by IP address. The "
"multiplayer <em>lobby</em> interface now displays detailed information about "
"existing games. A few new multiplayer maps were also added."

"Other changes in game content include new units, new terrain types, and "
"further balancing of unit stats and abilities. We have added progress bars "
"to major <em>loading</em> points in the game. We have also added some great "
"new music, and a host of new sound effects. There have also been some "
"rearrangements and improvements to the in-game help. "

"One major change is that we have undertaken a heavy revision of our sprite "
"imagery; affecting almost all units except the drakes, mermen, and naga, "
"intended to bring most of the units into consistent style and correct size. "
"A result of this is that units (which we've revised) that belong to "
"different teams, now show their team color on clothes and banners. We have "
"also completely replaced the icons representing the attacks of units. There "
"are a few new portraits and story pictures, some major improvements to "
"terrain graphics (especially the new mountains, cave, castles/encampments, "
"swamp, canyons, and tropical forests, not to mention a few others)."

"Developers and Modders can enjoy new WML (Wesnoth markup language) features, "
"including custom abilities, unit stat modification, more detailed events, "
"and the ability to script a custom AI in Python. Additionally, we have added "
"basic code support for the animation of walking, swimming, dying, and other "
"special actions; in doing so we've done a major cleanup of the WML that "
"describes said animations, making it much more consistent."
